## 🎬 SCRIPT

### INTRO (10 sec)
> "Hey team! Quick demo of Flutter's dev tools - Hot Reload, Debug Console, and DevTools. These make our development way faster."

---

### HOT RELOAD (25 sec)

**[Show app running]**

> "First, Hot Reload - watch this..."

**[Switch to code, change displayText]**

> "I'm changing this text... save... boom! Instant update, no restart needed."

**[Change background color, save]**

> "Changed the color too - and notice the counter didn't reset. State is preserved. This saves us tons of time during UI development."

---

### DEBUG CONSOLE (20 sec)

**[Show Debug Console]**

> "Next, Debug Console. I've added debugPrint statements throughout."

**[Tap buttons in app]**

> "See these logs? We get real-time feedback on everything happening in the app. Super useful for debugging."

---

### DEVTOOLS (30 sec)

**[Open DevTools]**

> "Finally, DevTools - our power tool."

**[Show Widget Inspector]**

> "Widget Inspector lets us see the entire widget tree and all properties. Great for fixing layout issues."

**[Show Performance tab]**

> "Performance tab shows frame rendering. Green bars mean we're hitting 60 FPS - smooth performance."

**[Quick pan of other tabs]**

> "Plus memory profiling, network monitoring, and more."

---

### CLOSE (10 sec)

> "These three tools together make Flutter development incredibly productive. Hot Reload for speed, Debug Console for visibility, DevTools for deep insights. Questions?"

---

## 🎯 SUPER SHORT VERSION (30 seconds)

> "Quick demo: Hot Reload updates UI instantly [show], Debug Console tracks everything [show logs], DevTools inspects widgets and performance [show inspector and perf]. These tools make our Flutter dev workflow super fast and efficient. Done!"

---

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**If they ask questions:**

**Q: How much time does Hot Reload save?**
> "Easily 5-10 minutes per hour - no more waiting for app restarts. Over a sprint, that's hours saved."

**Q: When do we use DevTools?**
> "During development for widget debugging, before PRs to check performance, and when investigating bugs. Should be open most of the time."

**Q: Do we need to remove debug logs before production?**
> "Yes! We should comment them out or remove before merging to main. Or use conditional logging."

# Flutter Project Structure

## Introduction
This document explains the folder structure of a Flutter project and the purpose of each file and directory generated by default. Understanding this structure is essential for building well-organized, scalable, and maintainable Flutter applications.

## Folder and File Explanation

### lib/
- Core folder of the Flutter application.
- Contains all Dart source code.
- `main.dart` is the entry point of the app.
- Common subfolders:
  - **screens/** – Application screens/pages
  - **widgets/** – Reusable UI components
  - **services/** – Business logic and API services
  - **models/** – Data models

---

### android/
- Contains Android-specific configuration and native code.
- Uses Gradle for build and dependency management.
- Important file:
  - `android/app/build.gradle` – app version, dependencies, and package settings

---

### ios/
- Contains iOS-specific configuration files.
- Used by Xcode to build and run the app on iOS devices.
- Important file:
  - `ios/Runner/Info.plist` – app permissions and metadata

---

### assets/
- Manually created folder for static resources.
- Stores images, fonts, icons, and JSON files.
- Assets must be declared in `pubspec.yaml`.

Example:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
test/
Contains automated test files.

Used for unit, widget, and integration testing.

Default file widget_test.dart is generated by Flutter.

pubspec.yaml
Main configuration file of the Flutter project.

Manages:

Dependencies

Assets

Fonts

SDK environment settings

Supporting Files and Folders
README.md – Project documentation and setup instructions

.gitignore – Specifies files and folders ignored by Git

build/ – Auto-generated compiled output (do not edit manually)

.dart_tool/ – Dart and Flutter internal tooling files

.idea/ – IDE configuration files

Reflection
A clear Flutter project structure improves code readability, scalability, and collaboration. It allows teams to divide responsibilities efficiently, reduces merge conflicts, and supports Flutter’s cross-platform development for Android and iOS from a single codebase.

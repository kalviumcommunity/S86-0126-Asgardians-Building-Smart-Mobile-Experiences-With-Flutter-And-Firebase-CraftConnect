## Understanding Widget Tree & Reactive UI (Sprint #2)

### 📌 Description
This task demonstrates Flutter’s widget tree structure and its reactive UI model. A simple demo screen was created to show how widgets are arranged in a hierarchy and how the UI updates automatically when the state changes.

---

### 🌳 Widget Tree Hierarchy

Scaffold  
 ┣ AppBar  
 ┗ Body  
    ┗ Center  
       ┗ Column  
          ┣ Text  
          ┣ Container  
          ┗ ElevatedButton  

---

### 🔄 Reactive UI Model
Flutter uses a reactive UI approach. When the state changes using setState(), Flutter automatically rebuilds only the affected widgets instead of the whole screen. This makes UI updates fast and efficient.

In this demo:
- Initial UI shows default text and color
- Clicking the button updates the state
- Text and container color change instantly
- Only the required widgets are rebuilt

---

### 🧠 Learning Outcome
Through this task, I understood how Flutter builds UI using a widget tree and how state changes trigger automatic UI updates. This helped me clearly understand Flutter’s reactive design pattern and efficient rendering system.


# Multi-Screen Navigation Using Navigator & Routes

## Description

This task demonstrates how multiple screens are connected in the app using Flutter’s Navigator and named routes. Navigation was added to move smoothly between different pages, making the app structure scalable and easy to manage.

## Navigation Setup
The app includes the following screens for navigation:

DevTools Demo Screen (start screen)
Home Screen
Second Screen

Named routes are defined in main.dart, and navigation is handled using Navigator.pushNamed() and Navigator.pop().

## Navigation Flow
App opens on the DevTools Demo Screen
User navigates to Home Screen
From Home Screen, user navigates to Second Screen
User can return to previous screens using back navigation

### Learning Outcome

I learned how Flutter manages multiple screens using a navigation stack and how named routes make navigation clean and scalable for larger applications.


# Responsive Layout Using Row, Column & Container

### Description
A responsive layout screen was built using Container, Row, Column, and Expanded widgets. The layout adapts based on screen width using MediaQuery.

### Layout Design
- Header section at top
- Content area changes based on screen size
- Column layout for small screens
- Row layout for large screens

### Reflection
Responsive design ensures the app looks good on all devices. The main challenge was managing layout proportions using Expanded and switching between Row and Column layouts. This approach improves usability across phones and tablets.


# Consistent Styling and Theme Implementation

### Description
A global theme was applied to the app using ThemeData to ensure consistent colors, text styles, and button designs across all screens.

### What Was Implemented
- Common color palette using primarySwatch
- Global AppBar styling
- TextTheme for headings and body text
- ElevatedButtonTheme for consistent buttons
- Shared background color for all screens

### Reflection
Using a global theme makes the app look professional and consistent. It also reduces repeated styling code and makes future UI updates easier. The main challenge was replacing hardcoded styles with theme-based styles.


# Reusable Custom Widgets

## Description

This task demonstrates how reusable custom widgets can be created in Flutter to reduce code duplication and maintain consistent UI design. Common UI elements were refactored into reusable widgets and used across multiple screens to make the app modular and scalable.

## Custom Widgets Created

The following reusable widgets were created:

CustomButton
A reusable button widget used for navigation and actions across different screens.

InfoCard
A reusable card widget used to display structured information such as title, subtitle, and icon.

## Reuse Implementation

The same CustomButton widget is used in both Home Screen and Second Screen with different actions.
The InfoCard widget is reused multiple times on the Home Screen with different data.
This approach keeps the UI consistent and reduces repeated code.

### Learning Outcome

I learned how to break large UI code into smaller reusable components, making the codebase cleaner, easier to maintain, and faster to scale for team-based development.


# Animations and Transitions

## Description

Animations were added to enhance user experience and make interactions feel smooth and engaging.

## Animations Implemented

Implicit Animations using AnimatedContainer and AnimatedOpacity
UI elements animate smoothly on user interaction
Animated page navigation using custom route transitions

### Reflection

Animations improve usability by guiding user attention and making interactions intuitive.
I learned the difference between implicit and explicit animations and how to apply them meaningfully without affecting performance.


# Firebase Project Setup & Flutter Integration

## Description:
This task verifies the successful setup and integration of Firebase with the CraftConnect Flutter application. Firebase acts as the backend foundation for authentication, database, and future cloud features.

## Initialization

Firebase is initialized at app startup using Firebase.initializeApp() to ensure all Firebase services are available before the UI loads.

## Verification

Application runs without Firebase configuration errors
App appears as active under Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Apps
Firebase logs confirm successful initialization.

## Learning Outcome
This setup enables seamless integration of Firebase services like Authentication and Firestore in future features. Verifying the configuration helped reinforce understanding of one-time backend setup and how Flutter connects securely with cloud services.


# Firebase Authentication (Email & Password)

## Description

This task implements user authentication using Firebase Authentication with Email and Password in the CraftConnect Flutter application. Users can securely sign up for a new account or log in to an existing account, with all authentication handled by Firebase.

## Features Implemented

Email & Password authentication using Firebase Auth
User signup and login functionality
Toggle between Login and Signup modes
Error handling for invalid credentials
Authentication state synced with Firebase Console.

## Verification

Successfully registered users appear in Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
Login and signup actions work without backend configuration

### Reflection

Firebase Authentication simplifies user management by handling security, validation, and session management automatically. Compared to custom authentication systems, Firebase provides built-in security, scalability, and reliability. The main challenge was handling initialization order and managing authentication states correctly.


# Cloud Firestore Database Design – CraftConnect

## 📌 Description
This task focuses on designing a clear and scalable Cloud Firestore database structure for the CraftConnect application. The goal is to plan how app data will be stored using collections, documents, and subcollections without implementing CRUD operations yet. This schema is designed to support future features such as authentication, product listings, orders, and user interactions.

---

## 📋 Data Requirements
The CraftConnect app needs to store the following data:

- User profiles (artisans and customers)
- Product listings created by artisans
- Product categories
- Customer orders
- Order items for each order
- Timestamps for tracking creation and updates

---

## 🗂️ Firestore Collections Structure

### users (collection)
Stores user account and profile information.

**Document ID:** userId (Firebase Auth UID)

Fields:
- name: string  
- email: string  
- role: string (artisan / customer)  
- profileImage: string (URL)  
- createdAt: timestamp  

---

### products (collection)
Stores products listed by artisans.

**Document ID:** productId (auto-generated)

Fields:
- title: string  
- description: string  
- price: number  
- categoryId: string  
- artisanId: string (reference to users)

---

## Sample Firestore Documents

<!-- ### users/{userId}
```json
{
  "name": "Sri Charan",
  "email": "charan@example.com",
  "role": "artisan",
  "profileImage": "https://image.url",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}

{
  "title": "Handmade Pottery Vase",
  "description": "Eco-friendly handcrafted vase",
  "price": 899,
  "categoryId": "home_decor",
  "artisanId": "userId123",
  "imageUrl": "https://image.url",
  "isAvailable": true,
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
} -->

## Reflection

This Firestore structure was chosen to clearly separate users, products, and orders while allowing the app to scale efficiently as data grows. Subcollections are used where data can increase significantly, such as order items. The design avoids large arrays inside documents and uses timestamps for sorting and querying. This schema makes future CRUD operations, real-time updates, and performance optimization easier to implement.
